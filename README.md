### .init  

Hi, I'm Reis! I started coding at the age of 9, when my father brought home a CRT computer.  
I'm a self-taught developer currently studying Computer Science. You can find more about my background on my [LinkedIn](https://your-linkedin-url.com) profile.


### .now   

These days, I'm especially interested in how large language models process user input ‚Äî particularly around token counting and prompt structure.  
I'm also actively developing backend applications using Django, with a focus on scalable and maintainable system architecture.


### .code  

I use GitHub to archive code that I don't mind sharing publicly, and to contribute to open-source projects where I can offer meaningful improvements.

- üì¶ I archive side projects that are safe to share publicly.
- I contribute to community-driven and open-source projects when possible.


### .hist  

At age 10, after reading intriguing topics in National Geographic magazines, I searched ‚Äúhow to create a website‚Äù ‚Äî and that search opened the door to a world much bigger than I expected.  
Encouraged by other developers who appreciated my curiosity, I taught myself the essentials of front-end development.

- In 2016, at just 13 years old, I ranked 16th among 1,000 participants in a website competition by webMe. My site was featured as an example for new users on the platform.  
- I began creating Flash games using design tools and ActionScript 3.0 for Flash Player 9+, and later built a game website to host them.  
- I learned C to develop scripts for multiplayer games, writing and sharing custom libraries on community forums for about 4 years.  
- In 2020, I returned to backend development and started building crowdsourced dictionary-style apps with Django, focusing on content architecture and user-contributed systems.
